# Rock paper scissors - frontend web development mini project
 

Each player chooses either rock/stone, paper, or scissors. The items chosen by player and computer are compared, and whosoever chooses the more powerful item wins the game.

## The possible outcomes are:

- Rock destroys scissors.
- Scissors cut paper.
- Paper covers rock.
- In case the same choice appears the game is drawn i.e. tie occurs.


## Our code is broken  down into four parts:

- Get the user’s choice.
- Get the computer’s choice.
- Compare the two choices and determine a winner.
- Start the program and display the results along with scores.
